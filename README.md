##User Account and Password System

This Python program implements a simple login system for the Group B Alliance. Users can either log in with existing credentials or create a new account. The system generates secure passwords and provides feedback on their strength. Additionally, there is a feature to check the age of a user's password.

Features
Login or Create an Account:

Choose option 1 to log in with an existing username and password.
Choose option 2 to create a new account with a randomly generated or user-defined username and password.
Password Generation:

When creating an account, users can choose to generate a random password or enter their own.
The program ensures password complexity based on length and user preferences.
Password Strength Feedback:

After creating a password, users receive feedback on its strength (weak, medium, or strong) with specific improvement suggestions.

Note: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine before running the program.
